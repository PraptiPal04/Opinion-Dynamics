Investigation of the nonlinear system of differential equations for opinion dynamics
The file RKF.py contains the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg function to solve the system. 
The file dynamics.py contains the nonlinear system of differential equations as well as the functions for defining different adjacency matrices. 
The file parameter_map.py contains functions to plot the maps of different parameters.
